Introduction

The contemporary Web Application assessment requirement is to create a responsive single page application which will support students and other categories of users in aspects of their daily lives.
The design thinking methodology has been used in approaching the project.
The methodology will help the developer in creating a React application from the early stages where, the problem is not even defined yet.
As the application should support students in their aspects of their daily lives, the developer took his own experience as a starting point.
As a professional, working on an office environment, I have used multiple time management apps, dedicated to work tasks, where meetings can be schedules, notification prompted, lock periods of time on calendar with different status, and many other features that, if used correctly it can be a very helpful partner.
As a student, there are multiple tasks that needs to be taken in consideration, such as assessments deadline, include part of assessment into the final submission, change of schedule that many times they can be missed.
Personal and family matters, such as paying a bill, order a product online or remember a meeting time needs to be done as planned and if missed can have different consequences.
The app that I would like to develop will try to offer a simple solution to all this time management problems.
The app will act as a piece of paper that will help the user to write on the tasks for the day or for the week and they can be marked as complete, or they can be completely deleted.


Methodology

The methodology that will be used throughout this project is Design Thinking; this approach will help develop the application on the early stages by following a set of methods that will help understand the users and their needs, challenge the assumptions, find the problems, or redefine them and create innovative solution that it will then be shaped into a prototype which can be tested and improved.
The most important characteristic of the Design Thinking approach is its non-linearity, meaning that the developer can iterate through out the process as many times as is needed to be able to amend or even change the prototype if the outcome is not in line with the goals.

On the empathize phase the problem has been found which is time management.
Based on the survey data the problem has been entirely defined and it has been ideating the problem statement: the perception of the student regarding the time management, with the solution in creating an app that is focusing on simplicity but with a powerful problem-solving impact to the user.


Methods
React app has been created where a the user can login with the google account and access a simple to do list.
The user has the option to input a task and it will be displayed on the list on the same page.
Once the task is displayed the user can mark the task as complete or if it is completed the user can delete the task from the to do list.
The information resulted from the input from the app is securely stored online
The app is hosted online, and it can be accessed with the link :
The Google login option, the database and the online hosting has been implemented using the Firebase platform
Due to limited time and being a beginner as a developer the app is still in development but with the functional features presented.
After the app has been implemented with the semi functional features presented above, it has been sent to the same ten people, family and friends, to test the app in their daily activities.
The people have been asked to give marks from 1 to 10 to aspects of the application.
The summary of the test result is presented below:
  ----- ------------------------------------- ---------------
  No.   Criteria                              Average score
  1     **Interfaces**                        5
  2     **Regional Structure**                6
  3     **Colour scheme**                     2
  5     **Data Model**                        6
  6     **Visibility of system status**       4
  7     **Aesthetic and minimalist design**   7
  8     **Content**                           7
  9     **Usability**                         9
  10    **User Experience**                   8
  ----- ------------------------------------- ---------------

The testers have been invited to short conversation about the functionality of the app where they can share their opinion and also understand the phase where the project is at the moment and what is the desired outcome.
In the open discussion the Figma prototype has also been presented and explained how is the process of creating an app what are the steps and what is the goal
Even the testers haven’t grade, the app with good marks which, being on an early stage of implementation is understandable, overall, they have been satisfied by the app’s utility.
The testers have been impressed by the Figma design and have assured me that, if the app will be implemented with the presented design, even with it’s simplicity functions it can be very attractive.

Conclusion
All the phases of the design thinking methodology, in an enterprise environment they can be grouped into departments, therefore the project offered an interesting view of a real-life development company and how it can behave into production.
The prototype phase, which is the React app provided as part of this assessment has been developed following the module lectures and the tutor’s videos combined with personal research and video tutorials.
Writing the code, implementing logic and troubleshooting was the most challenging part of the project that once completed offers experience that can be used on completing the app and also in developing new projects
As s still a prototype, the app will be improved based on the test results and the desired outcome.
As a developer with the main interest in the app success, it has been also tested on personal purpose and considering the knowledge gained in such a short time the outcome is satisfactory.
